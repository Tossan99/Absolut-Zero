## Design

### Logo
Our logo, ABSOLUT ZERO, embodies the essence of our brand with its bold and distinctive design. The word "ABSOLUT" is rendered in a big, bold black font reminiscent of the iconic Absolut Vodka logo. Meanwhile, "ZERO" is presented in the same font but with a color resembling frost, symbolizing purity and reminds customer the refreshing feeling of a cold drink. This combination creates a striking visual impact that instantly captures attention.

![Logo](documentation/readme_images/absolut-logo-black.png)

### Fonts
For the design of our website, we've chosen Roboto for all normal texts and Roboto Slab for headings. This combination provides a modern and clean aesthetic, ensuring readability and visual appeal across all devices and screen sizes. Roboto's versatility and sleek design perfectly complement our minimalist approach, while Roboto Slab adds a touch of sophistication to our headings, enhancing the overall user experience.

![Fonts](documentation/readme_images/font.JPG)

### Color
Our color palette is intentionally limited to black, white, blue, and light gray. This minimalist approach creates a clean and cohesive visual identity, allowing the content and products to take center stage. The use of black and white provides a timeless and elegant backdrop, while blue is strategically employed for small details such as buttons and borders, adding subtle pops of color without overwhelming the design. The light gray serves as a soft background color, enhancing readability and creating a sense of space and tranquility throughout the website.

![Color Palette Image](documentation/readme_images/color-palette.JPG)

### Wireframes

These wireframes is a simple layout sketch used in the early design stages to plan the structure and key elements of the E-commerce. It provides a visual guide without delving into specific details, aiding in the initial planning of the design.
All wireframes was created with the help of [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

## Database and models

[ElephantSQL](https://customer.elephantsql.com/) was used as a database for the whole project.

Mapping out the database structure before coding is crucial for organizing information, reducing errors, and improving efficiency. That is why a Database schema was made before the start of development. 
[dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) was used to generate the database schema.

The Database schema has been slightly altered through development due to new ideas.

![Database Schema Image](documentation/readme_images/database-schema.png)

### Product Model

The ``Product`` model is the main model and is linked to the ``Category``, ``Subcategory``, ``DiscountProduct``, ``ProductRating``, ``ProductReview`` and ``OrderLineItem`` models. It's main purpose is to store information about a product.

### Category Model

The ``Category`` model is linked to the ``Product`` model and stores the different types of categories for the ``Product`` model.

### Subcategory Model

The ``Subcategory`` model is linked to the ``Product`` model and stores the different types of subcategories for the ``Product`` model.

### DiscountProduct Model

The ``DiscountProduct`` model is linked to the ``Product`` model and is used to set discounts linked to the ``Product`` model.

### ProductRating Model

The ``ProductRating`` model is linked to the ``Product`` model and is used to det ratings linked to the ``Product`` model.

### ProductReview Model

The ``DiscountProduct`` model is linked to the ``Product`` model and is used to write reviews linked to the ``Product`` model.

### User(Allauth) Model

The ``User`` model is an integral component of Django Allauth, featuring pre-established fields as part of its standard configuration. This model primarily serves the purpose of user authentication, which is why it is not recommended to make direct alterations to it. Furthermore, the ``User`` model is linked to the ``UserProfile`` model through a one-to-one relationship, facilitating the management of user-specific data and interactions.

### UserProfile Model

The ``UserProfile`` model is linked to the ``User`` model and stores the contact information of the user.

### Order Model

The ``Order`` model is linked to the ``UserProfile`` model and stores information about a users order. It grabs the product information through the ``OrderLineItem`` model to get the type of product, quantity and total price.

### OrderLineItem Model

The ``OrderLineItem`` model is linked to the ``Order`` model and assists it to complete and store the order.

### Epics

All user stories were divided into epics, representing larger user stories. In total, four epics were created to cover the entire project.

### User Stories as GitHub Issues

Turning user stories into GitHub issues helps organize user-focused features. These issues are linked to their corresponding user stories, making it easier to access criteria, tasks, and discussions.

### Bug Tracking for Seamless Development

We document bugs found during development as GitHub issues. This provides details on each bug's characteristics, impact, and how to reproduce it. By adding links to these issues in README.md, users can stay informed about bug fixes and share their thoughts.

### User Story Distribution (MoSCoW)

For this project, MoSCoW was used for the user stories to prioritizes implementation of features. MoSCoW is a project management framework that prioritizes requirements into four categories: `Must Have` (critical for success), `Should Have` (important), `Could Have` (desirable if resources permit), and `Won't Have` (explicitly excluded or deferred).

As seen in the chart below, the user stories prioritized as `Must Have` account for approximately 60%, while those prioritized as `Could Have` account for approximately 20%. The remaining 20% is shared between `Should Have` and `Won't Have`.

![MoSCoW Pie Chart](documentation/readme_images/absolut_zero_moscow_piechart.png)

<small>The percentages aren't displayed in the pie chart since it's considered poor data representation to use percentage points for any data with fewer than 100 data points.</small>

     Note: If using ElephantSQL as PostgreSQL provider, you can use the URL provided by ElephantSQL.

 **Environment Variable Setup:**
   - Create a new file in workspace called `env.py`.
   - Import the `os` library and set the environment variable for `DATABASE_URL` to the Heroku address (or ElephantSQL URL)
   - Add a secret key using `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your secret key here"`.

 **Heroku Config Vars:**
   - Add the secret key to the Heroku app's config vars in the settings.

 **Django Settings:**
   - In `settings.py` of Django app, import `Path` from `pathlib`, `os`, and `dj_database_url`.
   - Add `if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env` to the file.
   - Replace the SECRET_KEY with `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`.
   - Replace the database section with `DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}`.

 **Migrate Models:**
   - In workspace terminal, migrate the models to the new database connection.

### Custom Domain configuration

1. **Register Domain:**
   - Register a domain with a domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy).

2. **Add Custom Domain in Heroku:**
   - Go to the "Settings" tab of your Heroku app.
   - Scroll down to "Domains" and click "Add Domain."
   - Enter your custom domain (e.g., `www.absolutzero.com`).
   - Copy the provided DNS target. It will look something like `shallow-atoll-32t56jvds3s5fhf8767d9a9c.herokudns.com`.

3. **Configure DNS Records:**
   - Log in to your domain registrar.
   - Navigate to DNS settings.
   - Add a CNAME record:
      - Type: CNAME
      - Name: www
      - Value: Paste Heroku's DNS target
      - TTL: Set to default

4. **Verify Domain Configuration:**
   - Check the "Domains" section in your Heroku dashboard.
   - Wait for DNS changes to propagate (up to 48 hours).

5. **HTTP and HTTPS Forwarding (Optional):**
   - Optionally, configure forwarding in your domain registrar's settings.

6. **Verify Custom Domain:**
   - After DNS propagation, access your app using the custom domain.

6. **Add ACCESS_HOSTNAME to your project settings:**
   - Add "www.yourdomain.com" to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in your Django app's settings.py file.

### Version Control
To manage version control and push code to the main repository on GitHub using GitPod, follow these steps:

 **Add Changes:**
   - In the GitPod terminal, use the command `git add .` to stage changes.

 **Commit Changes:**
   - Commit changes with a descriptive comment using the command:
     ```
     git commit -m "Push comment here"
     ```

 **Push to GitHub:**
   - Push the updates to the repository on GitHub with the command:
     ```
     git push
     ```


 **Migrate Models:**
    - In the terminal, migrate the models to the new database connection.
